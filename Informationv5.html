  <h1> Ionic Substances: </h1>
  <div class="intro"> <p> When a cation bonds to an anion, an ionic compound is formed. The ions that make up an ionic compound are arranged in a three-dimensional lattice. This means each cation is surrounded by anions and, in turn each anion is surrounded by cations. the lattice is held together by the forces of attraction between the oppositly charged ions. This is called an electrostatic force. These forces are very strong.</p> </div>

  <h3> CATION: </h3>
      <div class="def"> <p> A positively charged atom, or group of atoms, that has lost one or more electrons. </p> </div>
  <h3> ANION: </h3>
      <div class="def"> <p> A negatively charged atom, or group of atoms, that has gained one or more elctrons. </p> </div>

<!--- Ionic Bond -->    

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -25px;"> <h2>The Ionic Bond: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> An ionic bond describes the force of attraction that holds ions together in an ionic substance. They arise because of the strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> When sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas, the sodium loses one valence electron and that electron is gained by the chlorine atom. The product of the reaction, is made up of sodium ions and chloride ions. The cations and anions are held together by strong elctrostatic forces of attraction.</p> </div>

<!--- Melting Point -->

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Melting Points of Ionic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Ionic substances have high melting points. The strong electrostatic forces holding the cations and anions are therefore hard to break. These strong ionic bonds require a lot of heat energy to break. </p>
  <p> Applying heat will cause the particles to begin vibrating more intensly. Melting will occur when the bonds that are holding the particles together, weaken. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Magnesium Chloride consists of positively charged cations (magnesium ion) and negatively charged anions (chloride ion). These ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction in a lattice structure. A lot of heat energy is required to overcome these ionic bonds, allowing the ions to move around more freely and for the solid to become a liquid. </p> </div>

<!--- solubility of ionic substances -->

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Solubility of Ionic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> When an ionic substance dissolves, the ionic bonds holding the ions in place must be broken. Polar solvents are attracted to the ions, where the negatively charged region of a solvent molecule is attracted to the positively charged cations and the positively charged region of a solvent molecule is attracted to the negatively charged anions. If the force of attraction between an ion and the solvent molecule is greater then the force of attraction between the ions, the solid will dissolve. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Sodium Chloride is an ionic substance. It is made up of alternating positively charged sodium cations and negatively charged chloride anions. These ions are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions in a rigid 3D lattice. Sodium chloride dissolves in water because water is a polar solvent. The negatively charged ends of the water molecules are attracted to the positively charged sodium cations. The positively charged ends of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively charged chloride anions. The force of attraction between the solvent molecules and ions is greater then the force of attraction between the ions themselves. Therefore the water molecules are able to break the lattice structure and pull the ions into solution. </p> </div>

<!--- conductivity of ionic substances -->

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Conductivity of Ionic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> In order to be electrically conductive, a substance needs either delocalised, free moving, charged electrons or ions. </p>
  <p> Ionic substances cannot conduct electricity because they have no delocalised, free moving, charged electrons or ions. However when ionic substances are melted or dissolved, they can conduct electricity. </p>


<!--- Hardness of ionic substances -->

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -100px;"> <h2> Hardness of Ionic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> In hard solids the particles are held together by very strong forces of attraction. Ionic substances are very hard because of their closely-packed 3D lattice structure and the strong bonds between the charged ions. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Aluminium Oxide consists of alternating positively charged aluminium ions and negatively charged oxygen ions. These ions are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction in a regular 3D lattice structure. Because the ions are held together strongly in the solid, aluminium oxide is a very hard substance. </p> </div>

<!--- Brittleness of ionic substances -->

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -100px;"> <h2> Brittleness of Ionic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Ionic solids are not able to be shaped by using force. the strong electrostatic forces holding the ions in place can resist very high stress. However, when the force applied exceeds the strength of electrostatic forces, the sections of the ionic solid move, causing the lattice to shatter. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 
  <p> Rutile lenses consist of alternating positively charged titanium cations and negatively charged oxide ions. These ions are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction in a regular 3D lattice structure. When the lens was dropped the force on the rutile exceeded the strength of the bonds holding the ions together. Ions of similar charge were moved closer to each other, and the repulsive electrostatic forces between ions of the same charge made the ionic solid shatter. </p> </div>

  <h1> Molecular Substances: </h1> 
</div>

 <div class="intro"> <p> Molecular substances are almost always made up of non-metal atoms. Molecules consist of two or more atoms joined by covalent bonds.</p> </div>

<div class="headings"> <h2> The Covalent Bond: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Covalent bonds also known as intramolecular bonds are very strong bonds that hold the atoms together within a molecule. Covalent bonds between atoms arise from the sharing of a pair of valence electrons in order to achieve a full valence shell. The bonding electrons are found between the nuclei of atoms. </p>


<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -150px;"> <h2> Melting/Boiling Points of Molecular Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> In molecules, there are covalent bonds which are intramolecular. As well as these bonds, there are also attractive forces called intermolecular forces.
  The intermolecular forces of atttraction between molecules are relatively weak. these weak forces of attraction do not require much heat energy to overcome. this means that Molecular Substances have relatively low melting points.</p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> H2O is a molecular substance. The molecules are held together in the solid state by weak intermolecular forces of attraction. As these forces are weak, not much heat energy is needed to overcome these attractions between molecules so water has a relatively low melting point. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Solubility of Molecular Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p>polar molecules will dissolve in polar solvents and non-polar molecules will dissolve in non-polar solvents. "like dissolves in like". A polar molecule such as water, is polar because it is assymetrical and the polar covalent bonds do not cancel. Non-Polar molecules are symmetrical and the polar covalent bonds will cancel out. </p>

  <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

    <p>SO2 has two polar S-O bonds. Oxygen is the most electronegative atom. The SO2 molecule is assymetrical so these polar bonds do not cancel and SO2 is a polar molecule. H2O has two polar H-O bonds. Oxygen is the most electronegative atom. The H2O molecule is assymetrical so these polar bonds do not cancel and H2O is a polar molecule. Since polar liquids will dissolve in other polar liquids, Sulfur Dioxide will dissolve in water. </p>

<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Conductivity of Molecular Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p>Molecular substances do not conduct electricity as they do not contain electrically charged particles that are free to move. Instead molecular substances are known as inductors.</p>

  <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

    <p> Oxygen is an insulator because it is a molecular substance. Molecular substances are made up of molecules with no electrical charge. There are no free to move ions or electrons in oxygen to carry electrical charge. </p>

<div class="text">
 <h1> Metallic Substances: </h1>
 <div class="intro"> <p> The majority of elements on the periodic table are metals. They occur on the left-hand side and all metals have partially filled valence shells.</p> </div>

<div class="headings"> <h2> Metallic Bonding: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> In a metal there are strong attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei, and the negativelly charged, delocalised valence electrons. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Metallic bonding is a strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal nuclei and the 'sea' of delocalised valence electrons that surround them. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Melting Points - Metallic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Metals have relatively high melting points due to the metallic bonds. There are strong forces of attraction between the delocalised electrons and the positive nuclei of the atoms. These forces of attraction are hard to overcome.</p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Copper is a metal. Solid copper metal consists of copper atoms held together in a three-dimensional lattice by metallic bonding in which valence electrons are attracted to the nuclei of neighbouring atoms. The attractive forces are strong electrostatic forces that require a lot of heat energy to overcome so copper metal has a relatively high melting point. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Solubulity of Metallic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Metals are insoluble in any type of solvent. The metallic bond is too strong to be overcome by the attractive forces between the solvent and the particles that make up a metal. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Solid iron metal consists of iron atoms held together in a three dimensional lattice by metallic bonding in which valence electrons are attracted to the nuclei of neighbouring atoms. The bonds holding the positively charged nuclei and delocalised electrons are too strong to be overcome by the attractive forces of water molecules, so iron metal is insoluble in water. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Conduction of Metallic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> All metals have high electrical conductivity. This is because the valence electrons of metal atoms are free to move throughout the metal lattice, and so they can carry an electrical current. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Sodium is a metal. It consists of sodium atoms held together in a three dimensional lattice by metallic bonding in which valence electrons are attracted to the nuclei of neighbouring atoms. The valence electrons are free to move through the lattice, therefore they are able to conduct electricity when sodium is in the solid and liquid states. </p> </div>

   <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Malleability - Metallic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Malleability describes how metals are able to be shaped using force. Even though the metal nuclei are forced into a new position, they will still experience strong electrostatic bonding to the 'sea' of valence electrons due to the non-directional nature of the bonds. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Silver is a metallic solid. It is made up of positively charged metal nuclei in a lattice arrangement, surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised valence electrons. Metals are malleable because of the type of bonding they have. When a force is applied to the metal, the positively charged nuclei are able to change position and still experience non-directional electrostatic attractions to nearby delocalised valence elecrons. </p> </div>


  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -105px;"> <h2> Ductility - Metallic Substances: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Ductility describes how metals are able to be drawn into thin wires. Even though the metal nuclei are forced into a new position, they will still experience strong electrostatic bonding to the 'sea' of valence electrons due to the non-directional nature of the bonds. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Copper is composed of copper cations held together in a three dimensional lattice by metallic bonding, in which delocalised valence electrons are attracted to the nuclei of neighbouring atoms. The delocalised valence electrons are free to move through the lattice, therefore they are able to conduct electricity. The attraction of the copper atoms for the valence electrons is not in any particular direction, therefore copper atoms can move past one another, and so copper is ductile and can be drawn out into wires without breaking. </p> </div>

 <h1> Covalent Network Substances: </h1>
 <div class="intro"> <p> Covalent Network Substances are large networks of non-metal atoms held together by covalent bonds. Covalent networks can be linear chains, two-dimensional layers or three-dimensional networks. </p> </div>

 <div class="headings" style="margin: -30px 0 0 -50px;"> <h2> 1D Covalent Networks </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
<br>
 <h4> Melting Point: </h4> 
  <p> One-dimensional Covalent Networks have low melting points. Neighbouring chains are held together by weak intermolecular forces. Only a small amount of heat energy is required to seperate the chains and, therefore change their state. However, the longer the carbon chain, the greater the force of attraction between the molecules. This means the melting point increases with increasing carbon chain length. </p>

<h4> Electrical Conductivity: </h4>
<p> One-dimensional Covalent Networks are electrical insulators as there are no free electrons or ions in the molecules that can carry an electrical current. </p>

<h4> Solubility: </h4>
<p> One-dimensional Covalent Networks are large uncharged molecules and so they have weak attractions to water molecules, so they are insoluble in polar solvents. </p>


<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -55px;"> <h2> 2D Covalent Networks </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
<br>
 <h4> Melting Point: </h4> 
  <p> Two-dimensional Covalent Networks has a high melting point. In order to melt these substances, the strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms must be broken. This means a large amount of heat energy is required to achieve this. </p>

<h4> Electrical Conductivity: </h4>
<p> Two-dimensional Covalent Networks such as graphite has a free delocalised electron from each carbon atom in the network that is able to move through the network and carry an electrical current. </p>

<h4> Solubility: </h4>
<p> Two-dimensional Covalent Networks are large uncharged molecules and so they have weak attractions to water molecules, so they are insoluble in polar solvents. </p>


<div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -55px;"> <h2> 3D Covalent Networks </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
<br>
 <h4> Melting Point: </h4> 
  <p> Three-dimensional Covalent Networks have high melting points. In order to melt these substances, the strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms must be broken. This means a very large amount of heat energy is required to achieve this. </p>

<h4> Electrical Conductivity: </h4>
<p> Three-dimensional Covalent Networks are not electrical conductors as there are no free electrons or ions in the molecules that can carry an electrical current. </p>

<h4> Solubility: </h4>
<p> three-dimensional Covalent Networks are insoluble in all liquids as the forece of attraction between the atoms is greater than the force of attraction between their atoms and the solvent molecules.</p>

<div class="text">
 <h1> Energy Changes: </h1>
 <div class="intro"> <p> Chemical reactions involve the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The general rule is that energy is absorbed in the breaking of chemical bonds, and energy is released when bonds are formed. </p> </div>

<div class="headings" style="margin: -30px 0 0 -50px;"> <h2> Exothermic Reactions: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Exothermic reactions are those reactions that release heat. The energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is exceeded by the energy released when chemical bonds are formed in the products. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Energy is absorbed to break the two covalent bonds linking hydrogen atoms, and the two covalent bonds linking the oxygen atoms. Energy is released when the water molecules form. Four covalent bonds forming between hydrogen and oxygen atoms release more energy than is required to break the bonds in the reactants. The excess energy is released into the environment. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -65px;"> <h2> Endothermic Reactions: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Endothermic reactions can be considered the opposite of exothermic reactions. They absorb energy from the environment. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> More energy is required to break the bonds in the water molecules than what is released when the reactants form. The excess energy is 'stored' in the chemical bonds of the reactants, and can be released when the hydrogen is burned as fuel. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px -20px 0 0px;"> <h2> Enthalpy: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Enthalpy is a term used to describe the energy within a chemical system. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Dissolving solid sodium hydroxide in water is an exothermic reaction because the energy released by the bonds forming between the sodium ions and water molecules, and hydroxide ions and water molecules, exceeds the amount of energy absorbed by breaking the bonds between the ions in the solid sodium hydroxide. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -20px;"> <h2> Breaking Bonds: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Breaking chemical bonds is an endothermic process. The input of energy is required to seperate particles that are joined by forces of attraction. These forces include ionic, covalent, metallic, and weak inermolecular attractions. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p>The metallic bonds between the positively charged metal nuclei and the 'sea' of delocalised valence electrons must be weakened to allow the metal to change state. Heat energy is absorbed by the metal making the particles move further apart, thus weakening the metallic bonds. This is an endothermic reaction.  </p> </div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -20px;"> <h2> Changes of State: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> When a substance changes state it is because chemical bonds between the particles of the substance have been either weakened or strengthened. Energy is absorbed to weaken or break bonds, so therefore melting and evaporating are endothermic processes. Energy is released when bonds strengthen or form, so theefore condensing and solidifying are exothermic processes. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> A person will feel cold after hopping out of the swimming pool because water is evaporating from the skin. The water molecules are absorbing heat energy from the skin and gaining enough kinetic energy to overcome the bonds holding them together as a liquid. The gaseous water molecules remove heat energy to leave the person's skin to feel cold. </p> </div>

  <div class="headings"  style="margin: -10px 0 0 -20px;"> <h2> Bond Enthalpy: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Bond Enthalpy is the energy needed to break the covalent bonds in gaseous molecules. The bond enthalpy will always be a positive number because energy is absorbed when breaking a bond. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Step 1: Calculate the energy required to break the reaction bonds. 
  <br> Step 2: Calculate the energy released when the bonds in the product are made.
  <br> Step 3: Calculate the change in enthalpy ((energy required to break bonds) - (energy released when bonds are made)) </p></div>

  <div class="headings" style="margin: -10px 0 0 -90px;"> <h2> Thermochemical Calculations: </h2> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<br>
  <p> Exam questions will involve calculating the amount of energy released or absorbed when a gven amount of reactant in consumed or product is formed. </p>

    <div class="eg"> <h3> eg: </h3> 

  <p> Step 1: Calculate the number of moles (n) in the mass (m) of substance stated.
    <br> Step 2: Determine how many moles of the substance gives the change in enthalpy for the equation.
    <br> Step 3: Multiply the number of moles of substance by the change in enthalpy and divide by (answer to Step 2) to find the energy released or absorbed.
    <br> Step 4: State whether the amount of energy was released or absorbed.
